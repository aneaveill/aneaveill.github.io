						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Practice Lab - "Introduce Yourself" 
						<ul>
							<li>Your very first program! This will allow you to expand on the "Hello World" program and give it your own personal touch. Additionally this will give you practice using an Online IDE </li>
							<li>Your task will be to write a program that prints output introducing yourself with at least 5 lines of output.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Exact Instruction Activity 
						<ul>
							<li>Gives you some practice being precise with your language of, details of, and order of your instructions. This is intended to give you some insight as to how the compiler will treat your code.</li>
							<li>Your task will be to partner up with someone in the room. After watching a video of how instructions can be... misinterpreted, you each write your own set of instructions to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Then, your partner must pick apart those instructions for any amount of vagueness or something that can be misunderstood.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						PracticeIT (Basic Methods/Functions) 
						<ul>
							<li>In this practice, you will get to write methods/functions and call methods/functions</li>
							<li>Remember, the main() method is the only one the program runs to start, and the order things are called within main() or any function within the main() matters.</li>
							<li>Building Java Programs, 5th Edition, Chapter 1, Self-Checks 21-28</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						PracticeIT (Code Cleanliness)

							<li>Building Java Programs, 5th Edition, Chapter 1, Self-Checks 30-32</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						PracticeIT (Math Operators) 
						<ul>
							<li>This is practice using the math operators in Java. The focus here is order of operations (P-E-MMD-AS, yes that extra M is on purpose for modulus % ).</li>
							<li>Remember, Math operations only carry the decimal through to the result if there was a decimal on either operand to begin with. Ex. 3/2 is 1, but 3.0/2, 3/2.0, and 3.0/2.0 all result in 1.5</li>
							<li>Also remember that a String (something in quotes) + anything results in a String combining the two. "hi" + 5 is "hi5", 2+"4" is 24, etc. Make sure you are working one operation at a time, with order of operations, left to right</li>
							<li>Building Java Programs, 5th Edition, Chapter 2, Self-Checks 1-5</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Note: on problems 3-5 you only need to evaluate 7 math expressions from each page, not the whole set.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						PracticeIT (Variables and Datatypes) 
						<ul>
							<li>In this one, the practice focuses on declaring and using variables with appropriate datatypes</li>
							<li>Building Java Programs, 5th Edition, Chapter 2, Self-Checks 6-10</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						PracticeIT (Math with Variables)

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Scanner Exit Ticket 
						<ul>
							<li>The focus of this exit ticket is to make sure you really understand how to import, declare and use a Scanner to get input</li>
							<li>The task is to write a small program that will ask the user for their favorite food. You then store that input into a variable and show that it was correctly scanned by using that variable in a sentence agreeing. Ex. "I think _______ is the best food ever" but the blank should instead be the value of their scanned input.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Unit 1 Study Guide 
						<ul>
							<li>Students will get a list of focus topics for the exam so they can compile notes, practice, and examples to assist them on the exam.</li>
